Lunar Rebellion

1	Building the Project

Do "ant all" to do everything to instantly run a clean compiled version of the
program in one command.

2	Storyline

Our main character starts off their journey on Enceladus where an authoritarian
alien dictatorship opresses the alien race to which they belong. In order to
overthrow this tyrant, our protagonist must travel through wormhole portals to
other moons of saturn where they can collect useful gear and powers that will
help them infiltrate the ruler's lair and defeat them.

3 Project Status 

For Sprint 1, we have created a simple platformer. 

4 Sprint 2 

For Sprint 2, our main objectives will be to implement a main menu, the overworld, and create level 1. 

Things to do next...
Kristof Y. - I'm going to finish the healthbar display and work on the damage functions.
