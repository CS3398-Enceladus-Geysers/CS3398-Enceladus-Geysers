**Lunar Rebellion**

**1 Building the Project**

Do "ant all" to do everything to instantly run a clean compiled version of the
program in one command.

**2 Storyline**

Our main character starts off their journey on Enceladus where an authoritarian
alien dictatorship opresses the alien race to which they belong. In order to
overthrow this tyrant, our protagonist must travel through wormhole portals to
other moons of saturn where they can collect useful gear and powers that will
help them infiltrate the ruler's lair and defeat them.

**3 Project Status **

For Sprint 1, we have created a simple platformer. 

**4 Sprint 2**

For Sprint 2, our main objectives will be to implement a main menu, the overworld, and create level 1. 

**Things to do next...**
**Kristof Y.** - I'm going to finish the healthbar display and work on the damage functions.
**Jazmine C.** - I'm going to finish the level and character design.
**Laura R.** - I'm planning to implement the game save class and start working on the overworld map asset.
**Maria J.** - I'm planning to continue working on Title scene and Start Menu
**Peter Wesley H.** - I'm planning to work on the overworld.

**5 Project Status after Sprint 2**

**At the end of sprint 2**, we completed level one by buidling the platforms and creating the obstacle class. We also added assets to the platforms and obstacles to match the aesthetic of the world. We also added a static space background. We also finished title screen and almost finished the main menu.  

**Next steps for Sprint 3**

**Kristof York**, I will start building the next level by placing platforms and obstacles.
**Laura Rice**, in the next sprint I plan to implement Game Over/Reset Methods using the GameSave and ResourceManager classes that I made in sprint 2.  
**Jazmine Castillo**, I will create an overworld and design the enemies and collectible items.
**Peter Hutcheson**, I will make a new file type to store levels in, to be easily edited independently of the other files.


**End of Sprint 3 (FINAL SPRINT)**

**Maria Jaramillo** - I worked mainly on Main.java. I created the title, main menu,
and settings. Also worked on the transition between these scenes.  The main
thing I was able to accomplish from Sprint 2 into Sprint 3 was being able to
have workable buttons and transitions for the title and main menu. Next step is
to hopefully keep working on the game and improve it.

**Jazmine Castillo** - I worked on the level 2 background, terrain, obstacle, items
and enemy assets. I also worked on Main.java to display the character options.
Next step would be to begin creating the assets for level 3 and to add the
ability for the user to actually choose their character.

**Laura Rice** - I worked on the Enemy class.  I also worked on restarting the game
if the player fell off the edge of the game or lost all their hitpoints.  If
the player died they would respawn at the last completed level.  If we had
another sprint, the next thing I would work on would be adding animation to our
enemy, add a loading scene when a character is moving on to the next level, and
add some kind game over message or animation when the player died.

**Kristof York** - I worked on the Enemy class as well. I made it to where whenever
the enemy hitbox collides with the player's, the player takes damage. I also
updated the healthbar so that the HP can be seen at all times. I also designed
level 2. I placed the blocks and the items for level 2. My next step would be to
make a function to allow the player to damage the enemy somehow.

**Peter Wesley Hutcheson** - I worked on Item.java, Portal.java, and Animation.java
in order to implement collectible items, animations, and changing levels. In a
future sprint, I would clean up and optimize the code significantly, and perhaps
create convenience methods and a new filetype to store levels.
